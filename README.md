# Data Structures and Algorithms, and others

It's hard for me to maintain notebooks and remember how I solved a particular problem by some fluke or a momentary grace of wisdom from heavens.

So I have decided to store all my codes, along with the comments and in some cases, READMe.s to help future me to revise stuff. Every question is either from LeetCode or CodeForces and I will try to maintain proper numbering and dates. (From this point onwards, 25th November, 2025).

If you are not the guy who wrote this and I didn't send this to you personally, absolutely no worries. Just bear in mind, neither I am a good teacher, nor am I organised, so if you want to use this as some kind of checklist for your interview prep, I would strongly suggest against it. 

But other than that if you stumbled here by chance, in search of a solution to a problem, your'e welcome!

Alright, that would be everything. All the best to anyone who stumbles around here. (Including me)
